## These are some prototypes i've done for my Image Recognition class at university.

## This project runs on Python3, and it requires the following libs installed:

* Numpy (for some image processing stuff)
* OpenCV
* Tesseract
* ImUtils
* ArgParse


### Ideally, when finished, there should be codes for:

* Recognizing all of the text in a image and turning it into a string
* Recognizing specific parts of text and only converting those sections
* Recognizing the monetary values of recepits and invoices and checking if everything adds up (i will probably scrap this idea up if i don't have time)
