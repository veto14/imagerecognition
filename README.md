## These are some prototypes i've done for my Image Recognition class at university.

python project.py --image "image path"

## This project runs on Python3, and it requires the following libs installed:

* Numpy (for some image processing stuff)
* OpenCV
* Tesseract
* ImUtils
* ArgParse


### Ideally, when finished, there should be codes for:

* Recognizing text in an image and turning it into a string
* Preprocessing blurred, crooked or noisy images to properly recognize the text on them
